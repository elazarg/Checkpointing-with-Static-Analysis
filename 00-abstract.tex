\begin{abstract}
We present a static analysis framework for Python programs that enables automatic synthesis of selective program checkpointing instrumentation, achieving checkpoint size reduction of 2--5 orders of magnitude compared to system-level alternatives (VM or process). Our approach combines points-to analysis, type inference, and liveness analysis, augmented with lightweight effect annotations for built-in types and external libraries. A key contribution is a specialization that performs escape analysis across loop iteration boundaries, automatically identifying minimal persistent state for iterative algorithms.

We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on realistic numerical Python programs: k-means clustering, orthogonal matching pursuit, and graph search algorithms. While static analysis of Python traditionally faces challenges due to its dynamic features, we show that established static analysis techniques, when carefully applied to idiomatic, structurally constrained Python code, can enable significant automated optimizations for an important class of numerical computing applications.
